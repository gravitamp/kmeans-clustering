Step 1 − First, we need to specify the number of clusters, K, need to be generated by this algorithm.

Step 2 − Next, randomly select K data points and assign each data point to a cluster. In simple words, 
        classify the data based on the number of data points.

Step 3 − Now it will compute the cluster centroids.

Step 4 − Next, keep iterating the following until we find optimal centroid which is 
        the assignment of data points to the clusters that are not changing any more

4.1 − First, the sum of squared distance between data points and centroids would be computed.

4.2 − Now, we have to assign each data point to the cluster that is closer than other cluster (centroid).

4.3 − At last compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of all data points of that cluster.



Assign the K number of clusters
Shuffle the data and randomly assign each data point to one of the K clusters and 
        assign initial random centroids.
Calculate the squared sum between each data point and all centroids.
Reassign each data point to the closest centroid based on the computation for step 3.
Reassign the centroid by calculating the mean value for every cluster
Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 until we no longer have to change anything in the clusters
